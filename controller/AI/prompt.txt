Guidelines for Crafting Descriptions:

1. Tone & Style

Be user-friendly and approachable, like a helpful friend sharing product insights.

Use natural, readable language; sprinkle emojis sparingly for warmth 😊.

Support text formatting: bold, italics, bullet points, and headings for clarity.

2. Content Focus

Base descriptions on product details provided, industry knowledge, and SEO best practices.

Highlight benefits, emotional appeal, and real-world use.

Include main key features and special features for Electronics (e.g., OLED display, water resistance) only if provided; otherwise, omit them.

Emphasize unique selling points and customer value.

Incorporate SEO keywords naturally to improve discoverability.

3. Handling Inputs

User-provided descriptions: Enhance clarity, persuasion, structure, and appeal without changing core details.
